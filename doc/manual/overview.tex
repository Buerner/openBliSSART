openBliSSART is a framework and toolbox for Blind Source Separation for Audio
Recognition Tasks. Main features include

\begin{itemize}
\item Component separation using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
  \cite{LeeSeung1999,Smaragdis2003,LeeSeung2001} and non-negative matrix deconvolution
  (NMD) \cite{Smaragdis2004}
\item Feature extraction from components
\item Creation of response variables assigning audio components to classes
\item Classification of components and assembly of audio files for different
  classes, such as in drum beat separation \cite{Virtanen2005}
\item Data export (ARFF \cite{Weka} and HTK \cite{HTKBook} formats)
\end{itemize}

\begin{leftbar}
In many places in this document and the applications, NMF and NMD are used
as synonyms. The reason is that mathematically NMF is a special case of NMD.

This manual is divided in two sections. Section \ref{section:Tutorial} provides
a brief introductory tutorial on how to use openBliSSART for a typical blind
source separation task. Section \ref{section:RefManual} explains the
openBliSSART toolbox and all of its configuration options in detail. For
detailed information about the openBliSSART framework please consult the
corresponding HTML documentation.
